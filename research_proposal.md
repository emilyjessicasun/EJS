# Introduction:
When I was a student at Needham High School, our classroom computers were equipped with Internet filtering software that blocked students from accessing certain websites. This meant that if you wanted to check Facebook during homeroom, you were out of luck—typing in the URL would bring you to an ominous maroon screen with the message, “Sorry, this webpage is not available at this time.” For the most part, I understood and even agreed with the school’s internet policy—an educational environment is no place for obscene material, and restricting access to various social media sites probably went a long way in focusing our attention on the subjects we were supposed to be learning.

Internet filters are widely used in US public schools in accordance with the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), a 2000 law that requires schools and public libraries to block web content that is obscene or “harmful to minors” in exchange for continued federal funding from the Library Services and Technology Act. The law has been controversial since its inception, although the Supreme Court withheld its constitutionality in 2003. 
Many argue that Internet censorship in US schools has a proven record of failure—both in censoring legitimate, non-obscene content with significant educational value, as well as ineffectively blocking truly inappropriate content. 

CIPA is often aggressive interpreted, with schools going well beyond the legal requirements in their implementation of content filters. The filtering software many use is not capable of determining, algorithmically, whether a website contains “harmful” content, and instead relies on broad keyword blocking, a method that often leads to the censorship of perfectly legitimate material.

Examples of blocked sites on school computers, according to an ACLU report, include the websites for PBS Kids and National Stop Bullying Day, online reports of global warming, and the homepage of former House Majority Leader Richard Armey. Others instances include brochures published by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, various Wikipedia pages, and information on LGBTQ health.

What’s more, the filtering software used by many schools might be failing in a more direct way—by actually allowing access to truly obscene content. In 2011, Homesafe, a network filter in Britain, made headlines when it was discovered to have failed to block PornHub.com, the third largest pornography provider on the web.

Finally, for many students, school computers the only way of accessing online content. For such individuals, biasing Internet access and preventing engagement with truly educational material is exceptionally damaging. When web filtering in US schools is not adequately doing its job, students in poor and rural regions are unfairly penalized.

# History:
Internet filtering falls within a long history of school censorship in the US. Thus, my proposed research is aimed at what is, essentially, a modern embodiment of a centuries-old tradition. Records of book banning in US schools span as far back as 1850, when Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter was deemed sinful and contrary to community values. Since then, schools have always had to juggle genuine concerns over exposing young children to offensive material and limiting their ability to access genuinely valuable content.

# Proposal:
Because any good analysis requires empirical evidence, I would like create a platform to document the real time incidence of school Internet filtering. I propose the creation of a new website where high school and middle school students can send in screenshots of sites blocked through their school computers. The website would collect entries, categorize and verify the information (if possible), and post to a broad database. Reports would contain the name of the school and town, with no further identifying information. 

My ultimate aim would be to supply school administrators, parents, and students with useful hard data in order to gauge the effectiveness of filtering software and make policy decisions regarding school internet censorship. Currently, there are only limited anecdotal examples of online school censorship, which seems woefully inadequate.

# Prior Art:
There are a few resources available to track online censorship, though not many. Herdict.org is a website and browser add-on run by the Berkman Center at Harvard University that provides a platform for aggregating real-time, crowdsourced data about Internet censorship, web filtering, and other online blockages. Its focus, however, is on the censorship itself, not the people whose access is being restricted. Currently, the only way to report that the censorship is on a school computer is by entering the information manually through under an option to “add details to report,” and very few people seem to do so. Researchers at the Center for Civic Media at MIT are working on the Mapping Information Access Project, which aims to provide a comprehensive record of how and what schools and library systems filter, the technology used, and challenges to blocked content are addressed. As of yet, however, it seems that the project is still in the developing stage. My website would be different in that it would focus on online censorship in US schools, and, with relatively low startup costs, would take little time to become fully functional.

# Methods:
My data would be screenshots submitted by students as well as their school and school location. I would not take into consideration what is actually being displayed as blocked. I believe that, at the data collection stage, my role would simply be to gather empirical evidence and compile a broad database, not judge whether or not certain instance of censorship is legitimate or not. Those who look at the data can decide for themselves what that data implies.

My analysis of the data would entail both a close reading of specific instances of censorship, to see if there is anything surprising, as well as a distant reading of the larger dataset in order to ascertain trends, differences across schools, and changes over time. Once I have enough data, I would seek to create infographics and charts displaying blocked sites based on school, region, or time interval. 

# Anticipated Results:
I anticipate that the vast majority of screenshots I would receive would be of legitimately obscene sites being blocked. However, I still expect that some, perhaps 10%, would be of instances of clearly misplaced censorship.

# Plan of Action
With very low startup costs, I have set a fairly simple plan of action. My first step would be to hire a web developer to actually create the site. Then, I would focus my attentions on social media advertising, which I think is the most effective way to reach wide swaths of young people. I would take out ads on Facebook, ask my friends to share online, post on Reddit, and tweet in a marketing blitz. 

I expect that, initially, my entry rate will be low, but will steadily increase over time. For the first month, my goal would be to receive one screenshot per day. For the next three months, I would aim for 3 entries a day. My ultimate goal would be to receive 30 screenshots per day. At that point, I will feel that I had successfully compiled a truly comprehensive database of school internet censorship.
